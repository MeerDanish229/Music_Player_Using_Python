I'm thrilled to share that I'm currently learning Python and working on my internship project at Codexcue. One of my latest tasks was to create a basic music player using Python and Tkinter.

It's a simple yet functional application that allows users to add songs to a playlist, select and play them, and use basic controls like play, pause, resume, stop, previous, and next. Here's a quick preview of the project:

## Technologies Used

Python: The backend logic for handling music playback.
Tkinter: The GUI library used to create the music player's user interface.
Pygame: Used for handling audio playback.
